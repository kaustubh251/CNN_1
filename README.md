# CNN_1
A Convolutional Neural Network was implemented to classify handwritten digits between 0 to 9.
Computational cost was reduced by using CNN.
20*20 image was reduced to 6*6 by applying convolution and average pooling on 20*20 image.
Neural Network had 3 layers consisting of 37 - 19 - 10 features.
